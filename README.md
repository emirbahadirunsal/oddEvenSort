Design and implement an algorithm to order an array of n integers such that eventually the even elements appear after the odd elements. The algorithm should run in O(n) time and use O(1) space (in addition to the array itself). The program should read its entire input into an array and then sort it in place. Finally it should print the resulting array and the number of comparison operations performed. The array can be sorted at any order as long as the even elements appear after the odd ones.
